This repo contains all that is needed to generate an Anki deck to learn the some important words for a traveller.
A collection of important words in English can be found [here](important_words.md).
These can be translated into any language supported by Google using [this script](generate_translations.py).
Pronunciation audio using Google's text-to-speech can then be generated using [this script](generate_audio.py).
Lastly, with [this script](generate_anki.py) an Anki deck can be created using the words, the translations, and the audio.
